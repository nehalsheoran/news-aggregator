Project Overview: News Aggregator Web App
The News Aggregator is a full-stack web application that consolidates news articles from various reputable sources (like NewsAPI, BBC, CNN, The Guardian, etc.) into a single, streamlined platform. The system categorizes, personalizes, and presents headlines based on user preferences and behavior, making news consumption smarter, faster, and more engaging.
 Key Features:

Smart Categorization: Allows users to browse news by category (Tech, Sports, Politics, etc.), source, and tags/keywords.

Search & Filters: Enables real-time keyword searches and filters by date, source, and popularity.

User Personalization: Uses login-based personalization to let users follow topics/sources and receive tailored recommendations.

Bookmarks & Profiles: Logged-in users can bookmark articles, manage preferences, and access saved content.

Responsive UI: Built with modern frontend frameworks like Next.js, featuring responsive design, light/dark modes, and infinite scroll.

Backend & APIs: Powered by Node.js/Express or Flask, integrated with third-party news APIs and a database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL) for storing user data and preferences.

Smart Features (optional): Integrates AI features like article summarization, sentiment analysis, and daily digest emails.
 Project Goals:
Simplify access to global news from one dashboard.

Enhance user engagement with smart filtering and personalization.

Enable a scalable, modern web experience for daily news readers.
